A server is a computer that provides data to other computers.                                                                                             It may serve data to systems on a local area network (LAN) or a wide area network (WAN) over the Internet.                                                                                              Many types of servers exist, including web servers, mail servers, and file servers.                                                                                           Each type runs software specific to the purpose of the server.
